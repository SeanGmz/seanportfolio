# 🌐 My Personal Portfolio

Welcome! I’m **Sean Patrick A. Gomez**, an Information Technology graduate and aspiring **full-stack web developer**.  

This portfolio is more than just a website — it’s a reflection of my journey as a developer, showcasing my projects, skills, and experiences.  

This portfolio is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that enables **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and seamless **API integration**. 

Whether you’re a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow developer, I invite you to explore my work. Feel free to connect — I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
